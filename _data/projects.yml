- title: "Training and Benchmarking Neural Machine Translation Models"
  members: "Ethan Mathieu, Shankara Abbineni"
  abstract: "In this project, we ask two questions: what are the gains to fine-tuning general langauge models on translation; and can general language models, when fine-tuned, perform better on translation tasks than a model trained solely for translation. As such, we train the DeLighT transformer model for English-to-French translation and compare its BLEU performance to other neural machine translation models which we fine-tune. We find that fine-tuned general language models can perform better than language-specific models. Additionally, we build a NextJS web application to allow end users to experiment with the different models and view their performance."

- title: "Improved Protein Function Prediction by Combining Persistent Cohomology and ProteinBERT Embeddings"
  members: "Anna Su, Jason Apostol"
  abstract: "Understanding the molecular function of proteins is extremely important in elucidating their biological mechanisms and in engineering new theraputics. We present a protein function classifier combining features from both sequence and structure, through embeddings generated by a pretrained ProteinBERT model trained on ~100 M proteins supplemented with structural generated on a molecular functionspecific implementation of PersLay trained on our smaller target dataset of ~6,000 human protein structures. We show that supplementing the sequence embeddings with structural embeddings improves classifier accuracy by approximately 4 % by using a relatively small number of parameters, and demonstrate that the H_1 homology group is the most important for performance. This work has applications to drug discovery, elucidation of biological pathways, and protein engineering, as it provides a high-fidelity estimate of the role of a protein in a biological system."
